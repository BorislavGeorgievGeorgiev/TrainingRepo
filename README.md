# TrainingRepo

In this repo I use the ***Ivaylo Kenov*** presentation and demos from his event "[Server Architectures with ASP.NET](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/ASP.NET-Server-Architectures)" and ***Kalin Tsenkov*** Github repositori "[BettingSystem](https://github.com/kalintsenkov/BettingSystem)" to train my skills.
